# Vijay's Terminal Portfolio
# Overview

This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to look and feel like a terminal interface.
Users can type commands such as home, about, projects, or contact to navigate and explore different sections — just like using a real command-line shell.

The goal of this project is to create a minimal yet interactive portfolio that reflects my personality as a Machine Learning and Data Science student, while keeping the interface developer-friendly and text-based.

🖥️ Features:
🧑‍💻 Command-line UI – Type commands to explore sections
📄 Dynamic responses – Displays info for each command like about, projects, skills, contact
💡 Customizable prompt – Terminal prompt with your name (e.g., vijay@portfolio:~$)
🌙 Dark theme – Minimal aesthetic with retro terminal color scheme
🧠 Lightweight – Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
⚙️ Easily extendable – Add more commands and outputs in script.js
